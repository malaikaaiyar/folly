The top-sky there is well-managed: <br>
bluffs of white cloud rank the channel <br>
past earlier gainsaid ports, along <br>
to where reeds, set left and right, halt <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winter’s hibernatory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;route to Ireland.

They run to the Shannon Pot,<br>
where the artists extract their inks.<br>
This morning is a mammoth, digging<br>
soil up beyond the sun, afar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to heights where breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes clouded,

and strings its hairs there like comets,<br>
signing off on white, untelling skies,<br>
blank, diplomatic skies, like those<br>
columbined ceilings in Europe’s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;largest rooms, after which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treaties are named.

The argument is, in essence,<br>
bicuspid, mooring its vessels<br>
sleekly at the waxy shore, whereof<br>
this borough of wick-stiff reeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calamity.
